# FaceAPI-DAI (Detect And Indentify) 
This is just a 'my first' C# WPF app! ;)

An C# WPF project which uses the Azure Face API to detect and indentify faces on images. It also includes Face Group, Person and Face Management. But let me be clear... I'm not a developer... I'm really a wannbe-developer! ;) So, don't judge my code. Honestly,.. I could not resist temptation to create an application which uses the Azure Face API.
